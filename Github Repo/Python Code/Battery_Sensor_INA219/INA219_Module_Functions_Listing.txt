Functions

INA219() constructs the class. The arguments, are:
shunt_ohms: The value of the shunt resistor in Ohms (mandatory).
max_expected_amps: The maximum expected current in Amps (optional).
address: The I2C address of the INA219, defaults to 0x40 (optional).
log_level: Set to logging.INFO to see the detailed calibration calculations and logging.DEBUG to see register operations (optional).
configure() configures and calibrates how the INA219 will take measurements. The arguments, which are all optional, are:
voltage_range: The full scale voltage range, this is either 16V or 32V, represented by one of the following constants (optional).
RANGE_16V: Range zero to 16 volts
RANGE_32V: Range zero to 32 volts (default). Device only supports upto 26V.
gain: The gain, which controls the maximum range of the shunt voltage, represented by one of the following constants (optional).
GAIN_1_40MV: Maximum shunt voltage 40mV
GAIN_2_80MV: Maximum shunt voltage 80mV
GAIN_4_160MV: Maximum shunt voltage 160mV
GAIN_8_320MV: Maximum shunt voltage 320mV
GAIN_AUTO: Automatically calculate the gain (default)

voltage() Returns the bus voltage in volts (V).
supply_voltage() Returns the bus supply voltage in volts (V). This is the sum of the bus voltage and shunt voltage. A DeviceRangeError exception is thrown if current overflow occurs.
current() Returns the bus current in milliamps (mA). A DeviceRangeError exception is thrown if current overflow occurs.
power() Returns the bus power consumption in milliwatts (mW). A DeviceRangeError exception is thrown if current overflow occurs.
shunt_voltage() Returns the shunt voltage in millivolts (mV). A DeviceRangeError exception is thrown if current overflow occurs.
current_overflow() Returns ‘True’ if an overflow has occured. Alternatively handle the DeviceRangeError exception as shown in the examples above.
sleep() Put the INA219 into power down mode.
wake() Wake the INA219 from power down mode.
reset() Reset the INA219 to its default configuration.
